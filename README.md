This system applies the Naive Bayes algorithm to the testing data to predict the sentiment of the reviews. 
Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic algorithm that is commonly used for text classification tasks. It works by calculating the probability of each word in a review belonging to a particular class (positive or negative) and combining these probabilities to obtain a final classification. 
To optimize the hyper parameters of the Naive Bayes classifier, we used the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm.By applying this algorithm, we were able to fine-tune the hyper parameters of the Naive Bayes classifier and achieve better performance in predicting the sentiment of the reviews.
