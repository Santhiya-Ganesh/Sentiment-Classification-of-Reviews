This system applies the Naive Bayes algorithm to the testing data to predict the sentiment of the reviews. 
Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic algorithm that is commonly used for text classification tasks. It works by calculating the probability of each word in a review belonging to a particular class (positive or negative) and combining these probabilities to obtain a final classification. 
To optimize the hyper parameters of the Naive Bayes classifier, we used the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm.By applying this algorithm, we were able to fine-tune the hyper parameters of the Naive Bayes classifier and achieve better performance in predicting the sentiment of the reviews.





#conclusion

In conclusion, aspect sentiment classification of a company using Naive Bayes and Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is a valuable task that can provide insights into the customer's perception of different aspects of the company.
 The combination of Naive Bayes and ABC algorithm can improve the performance of the classifier by optimizing its hyper parameters and feature weights. 
This model utilized the manually generated lexicons with hybrid regulations to handle a number of the key challenges in aspect-primarily based sentiment analysis mainly and sentiment evaluation in general. This approach reported high performance consequences through an included lexicon and rule-primarily based model.
